TestExpert
========

What is TestExpert
TestExpert is a framework which automatically generated JUnittests for Java applications.

Why use TestExpert
To shorted the time of writing unittests for already written code.
TestExpert fills the gap between writing code and writing test. Despite the succes of TDD - which is a great principle and I really like it - there 
are still numerous lines of code which should be covered by unittests. Writing them is a pretty tedious and long
process which will be hard to pick up - and finish. TestExpert can help. Just annotate your code with expectations
and generate a test. Collaborating classes will also be hammered out in the test so writing EasyMock / jMockit mocks although being a
nice job can be skipped.

No more writing of JUnit tests. Just expectations in the form of annotations

How
